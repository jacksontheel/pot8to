# Pot8to
## A Chip-8 emulator
Pot8to was written in C# using the Monogame framework. The emulation itself was handled here in the ChipSharp8 repository, while this repository handles things like the display and input.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Download the .NET SDK from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) to build the source. .NET 5 is used for this emulator.

### Installation
To build from source, in the command line of your choice `cd` to the Pot8to working directory and enter the command `dotnet build`. This will create the executable file in the Pot8to/bin/Debug/net5 directory.
